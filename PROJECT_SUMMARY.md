## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

### ✅ Separate Repository Approach
- Laravel app is completely separate from existing PHP dashboard
- Clean API boundary between frontend and backend
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Different technology stacks don't conflict

### ✅ Subdomain Structure
- `fitform100.com` - FastAPI backend
- `fitform100.net` - PHP internal analytics
- `ai.fitform100.net` - Laravel tenant portal (NEW)

### ✅ White-Label Design
- Tenant-facing interface
- TuneUp Fitness branding
- Separate authentication from internal tools
- Professional, modern UI
